# Password Generator

This is a Python script that generates random passwords. The passwords can be of any length, and they can include uppercase, lowercase, and symbols.

## Usage

To use the password generator, save the script as a `.py` file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the script as `password_generator.py`, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:


python password_generator.py
```

```
This will generate 5 random passwords and print them to the console.

## Options

The password generator has a few options that you can use to customize the passwords that it generates. These options are:

* `length`: The length of the passwords that you want to generate.
* `symbols`: Whether or not you want the passwords to include symbols.
* `uppercase`: Whether or not you want the passwords to include uppercase letters.

For example, to generate 10 passwords that are 20 characters long and include both symbols and uppercase letters, you would use the following command:

```
python password_generator.py --length 20 --symbols --uppercase
```

## Examples

Here are some examples of the passwords that the password generator can generate:

* `!Q@w23er4T`
* `asdfghjklPOI`
* `1234567890_-`
